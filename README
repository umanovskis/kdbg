This repo is a small fork of KDbg mainly for my own use.

The only new feature is that a generic command interface
has been added. There's a new window in the UI which
passes any commands directly to gdb, as entered. Doing
that is probably a bad idea for regular commands that
can be executed through the GUI, but it might be
necessary for architecture-specific gdb commands or other
advanced use cases.

Original readme follows.

==================

This is KDbg, a graphical user interface around GDB using
KDE, the K Desktop Environment.

To build and install:

	cmake .
	make
	sudo make install

It may be necessary to tell the install location explicitly,
then use, for example,

	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .

The KDE header files libraries must be available. Make sure
that the development packages are installed.
